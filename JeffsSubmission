# Critique #1: Kendrick Lamar’s ‘Mortal Man’ (‘To Pimp a Butterfly’ Poem) 


Kendrick Lamar’s third studio album, To Pimp a Butterfly (TPAB) is often regarded as one of the most influential pieces of music released in the last decade, blending Hip-Hop, Jazz, Funk, and spoken word to tell a beautiful story about identity, race, and the struggles of being a Black artist in America. Lamar also sheds light on the predatory nature of the music industry, something that can take something as pure and beautiful as a butterfly and “pimp” it for its own benefit and selfish causes.
This idea of exploitation is captured in the metaphor Lamar introduces at the end of the album, as he compares the artist to a caterpillar, trapped in its environment, forced to consume all that surrounds it just to survive. The caterpillar represents Lamar’s younger self, a prisoner to his surroundings growing up in Compton, often having to adopt destructive behaviors due to a system that frequently abandons marginalized communities. The butterfly, on the other hand, symbolizes the artist's talent, beauty, and potential. However, the caterpillar, conditioned by the surroundings it was exposed to, learns to exploit the butterfly, pimping it to its benefit, much like the music industry does to artists.
At the heart of TPAB lies a recurring poem that is expanded upon line by line at the end of each track, culminating in the final song “Mortal Man” (track 16). This poem ties together a lot of the key themes of the album and serves as a thread to communicate ideas to the listener, but also to build suspense and keep the listener engaged. As the poem unfolds, we’re offered a glimpse into Lamar’s journey not just as an artist but as a “mortal man,” navigating his personal vulnerabilities and expectations not just as an artist but as a leader in a divided world and self. In this critique, I'll explore how Lamar uses this poetic element to elevate the emotional impact of his work and employ narrative-driven digital storytelling.
As you get deeper into the album, you’re taken on a sort of emotional rollercoaster that I really enjoy, and I think it’s one of the best examples of how music has an ability to speak to us on a deeper level. I especially felt this in the contrast between the tracks “u” (track 6) and the penultimate track, “i” (track 15). Both of these songs serve as pivotal moments in the album, highlighting Lamar’s personal struggles and eventual triumph over his personal demons.
The transition from “These Walls” (track 5) to “u” I find particularly striking since it's where I find the poem really starts to take shape. “These Walls” ends with the line in the poem where Lamar finds himself “screaming in a hotel room,” setting the stage for the next track, “u,” which begins with Lamar screaming painfully into the microphone. This is one of the heavier songs on the album as it details Lamar’s feelings of self-loathing and guilt, perhaps feeling like he's not worthy of his success.
Fast forward to “i” and the listener experiences a complete tonal shift. “i” is like a breath of fresh air after the suffocating dark nature of “u” and other heavier songs on the album (“How Much a Dollar Cost” and “The Blacker the Berry,” for example). The upbeat nature of the song and Lamar's joyful delivery, combined with the echoing background of “I love myself,” resonates that much more. It's a really uplifting song, and I can't help but feel uplifted while I listen to it. This shift from not feeling at home in one’s own skin to self-acceptance is one that a lot of people face at some point in their lives, which is part of why I think it's such a powerful message.
Another thing I really like is that by placing these tracks at different points in the album, Lamar even more effectively highlights the internal struggles he faces while seeking self-acceptance and understanding. It also ties the songs together with the recurring poem really well; it serves as a sort of connecting thread to the overall message and narratives of the album and ultimately reinforces the main ideas around growth and transformation.
Overall, I think Kendrick Lamar really puts on a masterclass in digital storytelling with TPAB (as well as his previous album, good kid, m.A.A.d city) and uses poetic elements combined with powerful lyrics that create an emotional journey about identity, mental health, and resilience. His ability to weave his personal struggles into an overarching commentary on societal issues really helps to elevate his music and set a standard for not only musical artists but storytellers of all mediums, digital or not.


# Critique #2: Stardew Valley

Since its release in 2016, Stardew Valley has cemented itself as a standout title, celebrated not just for its charming art style and gameplay, but also for its exceptional digital storytelling, which develops in various ways depending on what the player decides to do and at what pace. This indie farming simulator, developed by Eric Barone—known professionally as ConcernedApe—invites players to explore the vibrant small town of Stardew Valley. It offers a rich digital narrative of community, woven through its vibrant pixel art style and fun, engaging game mechanics. Whether you're cultivating crops on your farm, fishing by the river, exploring the local mine, or fostering relationships with the local townsfolk, the player becomes part of a larger story about community, personal growth, and the pursuit of fulfillment and happiness in a consumerist world. In this critique, I will highlight several aspects of the game that, in my opinion, contribute significantly to its digital storytelling ability, of which there are many.
Character development is one of the main ways I find myself experiencing Stardew Valley’s expansive digital storytelling. It's one of the game’s most compelling elements. Each of the townsfolk has a unique backstory, personality, and set of relationships that players can explore and influence. The game encourages players to get to know the townsfolk and build friendships through dialogue, gift-giving, and participating in seasonal festivals and events. As players invest time into these relationships, they learn more about the struggles, aspirations, and hidden layers of each character. For instance, players might initially be put off by Shane's abrasiveness and general disdain for life in the valley. But as they get closer to him, they learn about his struggles with alcoholism and depression. This character-driven approach fosters emotional connections between the player and the characters, making the player feel like an essential part of the small, tight-knit community.
Another major aspect of Stardew Valley that contributes to its digital storytelling is player agency. The choices you're given in your actions. Unlike many games with linear storylines and narratives, Stardew Valley grants the player the freedom to shape their own story through choices and actions. These choices span a wide range, from deciding which skills to develop first to determining which relationships to pursue. This freedom creates a deeply personalized experience. For example, one player may choose to pursue relationships with the townsfolk, leading to marriage and starting a family. Others might focus on growing their farm, raising animals, or catching every variety of fish in the valley. This sense of agency not only empowers players but also makes the story feel more authentic and meaningful to them, allowing them to focus on what they personally value within the game.
I also found that the world-building in Stardew Valley complements its character development and the choices it gives the player. The town feels alive in a way, with its changing seasons, weather patterns, and community-driven events contributing to its ability to tell a digital story. The game doesn’t just hand players a static world to explore; instead, it allows them to discover hidden locations, unlock secrets about the town and its people, and learn the lore that gradually builds on their understanding of the world. Beyond the town itself, Stardew Valley invites players to shape their own narrative in countless, subtle ways. Whether it’s choosing to restore the community center at the town’s heart or helping to fill out the valley’s museum with artifacts found on their adventures, these decisions shape the town's future and contribute to the central narrative of a collective community. Each player's journey is almost always uniquely their own, contributing to that personalized feeling that makes everyone's experience with the game so engaging. What they decide to accomplish or pursue becomes a direct reflection of their own values and goals within the game world.
I’ll wrap up by saying that Stardew Valley is one of my personal favorite games and not just for its relaxing gameplay (which has been one of my saviors during exam season!), its amazing soundtrack, and its charming art style but also for the reasons I’ve listed above. The game provides an incredibly unique, intimate and fun way of telling a digital story, one that is truly yours to shape and experience however you decide. The combination of character development, player agency, and world-building creates a rich, immersive narrative that feels personal to each player, making Stardew Valley an exceptional example of how digital storytelling can evolve in games.

# Critique #3: UFC 306
Earlier this month, the mixed martial arts (MMA) event UFC 306, or Noche UFC, took place in Las Vegas at the innovative and groundbreaking venue, The Sphere. As someone who has closely followed MMA as a sport for quite a while, I was really excited when I learned that the UFC was heading to The Sphere for an event celebrating Mexican Independence Day. This occasion was not just a fight card; it was a tribute to the rich cultural heritage of Mexico, featuring a ten-fight lineup almost entirely composed of athletes of Mexican nationality or heritage.
What made this event particularly captivating was how the production team utilized the immersive screens within The Sphere to narrate the story of the Mexican people through a six part film series titled: “For Mexico, For All Time” that was shown throughout the main card of the event (final five fights). The audience was taken on a visual journey that highlighted the history of the Aztecs and the indigenous Mexican population, emphasizing the primal nature of combat as a cornerstone of their identity. This powerful digital storytelling framed the ensuing fights as more than mere competitions; they became a reflection of a cultural legacy steeped in struggle, resilience, and the eternal quest for independence.
While the tribute to legendary boxers like Julio César Chávez, Salvador Sánchez, and Rubén Olivares in the short film “Chapter Five: Fighters & Heroes” was a nice touch, I believe the event could have further honored Mexican athletes beyond these three icons. A more comprehensive dedication to UFC’s own Mexican athletes, beyond those featured in the event, would have enriched the celebration and provided a deeper connection to the present-day landscape of Mexican combat sports.
Aside from this, I thought the event was really special and as it unfolded the immersive technology of The Sphere really brought the narratives and digital stories to life. Even as i was sitting on my couch at home I felt a pretty good sense of immersion in the event and the stories that were being told. Each fight felt like it played into each chapter as part of a larger story, reflecting not just the athletes skills as they regularly do but also the cultural significance of the event definitely showed in the performance of some athletes, namely Daniel Zellhuber and Edgar Chairez, despite their losses they both put on some of the most exciting performances I've seen in my time watching MMA. 
Overall I thought the film series did an amazing job at telling their respective stories. “Chapter One: In The Beginning” set the stage through a cosmic backdrop describing the primal nature of fighting and that it's something woven deep within the fabric of humanity and that it's something that can take many forms. The next chapters detailed how these themes manifest themselves in Mexico’s rich history and fighting traditions, it also illustrated how just about every country on earth has its own fighting traditions which I thought was a nice touch. 
Another highlight of the event was "Chapter Four: Battle for Independence," which resonated with the themes of the event. Drawing parallels between the struggle of a nation fighting for independence and the personal battles of the country's warriors fighting in the cage on the night. It emphasized that each athlete not only represents themselves but their country and its history and the weight that must carry, I thought this was a cool thing to see as national pride is something a lot of athletes in the sport have in common as many of them come from smaller nations all over the world with little representation in the sporting world. 

The sixth and final chapter, “Mexico Today and Tomorrow” wrapped everything up quite nicely with the main event fight to follow. It highlighted the current state of affairs in Mexican combat sports as well as the future potential for new stars and legends to emerge, making it not just a celebration of past heroes but a beacon of hope for the future generations of Mexican athletes
Looking back on the event and the feature films about three weeks later, I’m more impressed with the event now than I was watching the event live, I’m not quite sure why this is but i think it's safe to say (for me at least) that this event was a landmark in digital storytelling and really showed what was capable with new venue technologies, UFC president Dana White called this event his “love letter” to Mexico and Mexican combat sports and while i still contest that more of a focus should’ve been made to honor Mexican MMA athletes and other boxers, i think he more than accomplished his goal as this was one of the best mediums for digital storytelling I have seen.
